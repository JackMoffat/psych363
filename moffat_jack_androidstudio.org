* Package Name
  Android Studio
** Short Description
Android Studio is an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for building your own Android apps.
It automatically creates the file structure for a number of useful basic App templates, has a useful GUI, and supports virtualization of a number of android devices (for example, simulating a Google Pixel3 XL).
** Review
   I'm just getting started with it and the Kotlin language it uses, but so far it is great. My plan for this is to build an app that encompasses a number of basic phone functions while excluding distracting factors like social media, email, etc.
